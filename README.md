# Popular-Place-Guesser
This project guesses famous places just by giving a clear picture of the place in the world ðŸ–¼.


**Description:**
This project typically uses the feature of Google's Gemini, which has the ability to give exact or near coordinates of the place just by giving it's clear picture.
Python's GUI library for Desktop Applicationa **TKINTER** is used in to achieve abstraction in order to be content specific.
User upload's and  image then the GEMINI model processes the picture and then displays the results on the Tkinter application.


**Note:**
In order to execute this program you would be needing tkinter installed by just using the command **pip install tkinter** on the shell/terminal.
Secondly git bash will be needed to export the **API KEY** of Gemini (remember make an account and find your api key in gemini).
Thirdly the image extension should be (.jpeg, .jpg, .png). 
Lastly execute the program and have fun :)
